Daily Questions for a Machine Learning Engineer.
+ *Context* - How can ML be used to help learn more about your problem?
+ *Data* - Do you need more data? What form does it need to be in? What do you do when data is missing?
+ *Modelling* - Which model should you use? Does it work too well on the data? Or why doesn't it work very well?
+ *Production* - How can you take your model to production? Should it be an online model or should it be updated at time intervals?
+ *Ongoing* - What happens if your model breaks? How do you improve it with more data? Is there a better way of doing things?

+ Bitcoin Historical Data Analysis: 

Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency, first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger (the blockchain) without the need for a trusted record

keeping authority or central intermediary. Transaction blocks contain a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of previous transaction blocks, and are thus “chained” together, serving as an immutable record of all transactions that have ever occurred.

As with any currency/commodity on the market, bitcoin trading and financial instruments soon followed public adoption of bitcoin and continue to grow. Included here is historical bitcoin market data at 1-min intervals for select bitcoin exchanges where trading takes place. Happy (data) mining!

 

+ Trending YouTube Video Statistics:

YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform.

According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users

interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”.

Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances,

and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.


+ Global Terrorism Database(GTD) : 

Information on more than 180,000 Terrorist Attacks

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017.

The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks.

The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.


+ Real Time Stock Market Data Analysis:

High-quality financial data is expensive to acquire and is therefore rarely shared for free.

Here I provide the full historical daily price and volume data for all US-based stocks and ETFs trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and NYSE MKT.

It’s one of the best datasets of its kind we can obtain.


+ TED Talks Data Analysis:

These datasets contain information about all audio-video recordings of TED Talks uploaded to the official TED.com website until September 21st, 2017.

The TED main dataset contains information about all talks including number of views, number of comments, descriptions, speakers and titles.

The TED transcripts dataset contains the transcripts for all talks available on TED.com.


+ Emojinator :

Emojis are ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages.

Emoji exist in various genres, including facial expressions, common objects, places and types of weather, and animals.

They are much like emoticons, but emoji are actual pictures instead of typographics

 
+ Drowsiness_Detection : This can be used by riders who tend to drive for a longer period of time that may lead to accidents

A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream

and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.

 
+ Build a deep reinforcement learning bot to play Flappy Bird : 

We may have played Flappy Bird sometime in the past. For those who don’t know, it was an extremely addictive Android game in which the aim was to keep flying the bird in air by avoiding obstacles.

In this application, a flappy bird Bot is created by using advanced reinforcement learning techniques. Here’s a demo of a trained bot.
 

+ Cred card Fraud Detection : It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

We will design Credit Card Fraud Detection system so that we can categorize transaction ad fraud and non-fraud using DL models.

 
+ Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting : 

This competition focuses on the problem of forecasting the future values of multiple time series,

as it has always been one of the most challenging problems in the field. More specifically,

we aim the competition at testing state-of-the-art methods designed by the participants,

on the problem of forecasting future web traffic for approximately 145,000 Wikipedia articles. 

WIKI Forecast Exploration (WTF EDA) : This challenge is about predicting the future behaviour of time series’ that describe the web traffic for Wikipedia articles


+ AVITO Duplicate Ads Detection:

Online marketplaces make it a breeze for users to both find and buy unique treasures or unload their dusty record collections in the spirit of spring cleaning. As one of the world’s largest and fastest growing online classifieds,

Avito hosts high volumes of listings and competitive sellers often go to great lengths to get their wares noticed.

 
+ Analyze Lending CLUB Issued LOANS:  

These files contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information.

The file containing loan data through the “present” contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the previous completed calendar quarter. Additional features include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes, and state, and collections among others.

The file is a matrix of about 890 thousand observations and 75 variables.


+ Weather Forecasting (Time Series and similar forecasting challenges)

       a) Unvariate Time Series Forecasting
       b) Multi-variate Time Series Forecasting
       c) Demand/Load Forecasting


+ WINE REVIEWS : 

After watching Somm (a documentary on master sommeliers) I wondered how I could create a predictive model to identify wines through blind tasting like a master sommelier would. The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review.

The model still won’t be able to taste the wine, but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give.
